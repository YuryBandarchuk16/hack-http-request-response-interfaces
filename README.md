PSR Http Message
================

This repository holds all interfaces/classes/traits related to
[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

Note that this is not a HTTP message implementation of its own. It is merely an
interface that describes a HTTP message. See the specification for more details.

Hack HTTP Request and Response Interfaces
=========================================

using PSR-7 as a starting point.
